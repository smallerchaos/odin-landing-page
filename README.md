Landing page for The Odin Project

## Learnings and Reflection

I was impressed at how fast I was able to set up the landing page! I think it was the exercises beforehand that gave me a pretty good idea of how flexbox works. I also labeled the sections of my css file. Overall, the project went well and I'm excited for the next part of the course.
